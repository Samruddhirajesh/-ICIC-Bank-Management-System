# -ICIC-Bank-Management-System

This project involves building a Bank Management System for ICIC Bank using SQL. The objective is to create a robust database to manage customer and employee data, enabling efficient data retrieval and management for day-to-day banking operations. The system includes multiple interrelated tables such as Bank Details, Employees, Customers, and Account Types, each with defined constraints like primary and foreign keys.

The project requires creating an Entity-Relationship (ER) model to ensure correct table relationships, and then building the database schema from scratch. The goal is to store and retrieve information about employees, customers, accounts, and departments seamlessly, enabling quick access to important details like employee roles, customer accounts, and more.

Through this system, the bank can efficiently track customersâ€™ account details, employee records, and departmental information, facilitating smooth operations and easy retrieval of data with just a few queries.

Deliverables:
Create ER Model
Build the database schema with all necessary tables and constraints
Insert relevant data into the tables
Solve SQL queries to retrieve required information
Submit final database structure and results
